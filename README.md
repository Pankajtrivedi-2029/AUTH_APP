I developed a MERN stack web application with secure authentication features, including login, sign-up, password reset, and email verification. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, ensuring fast and scalable server-side operations. Nodemailer is integrated for email verification and password reset functionality, enhancing security and user account management.

On the frontend, React.js delivers a dynamic and user-friendly experience, allowing seamless navigation and interaction. MongoDB serves as the database, efficiently managing user data while ensuring reliability and scalability.

The authentication system is designed with best security practices, incorporating hashed passwords and token-based authentication for added protection. Users receive verification emails upon signing up, ensuring only valid accounts gain access.

With a modern UI/UX, the app provides an intuitive experience, making authentication and account recovery simple and efficient. This project showcases expertise in full-stack development, authentication security, email handling, and database management, offering a robust and scalable solution for user authentication.
